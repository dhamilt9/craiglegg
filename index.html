						<h3>The Day Of</h3>
						<p>Hopefully you've decided to stay with us at the camp. If so, enjoy a
						relaxing day on the lake while catching up with friends and family.
						There is no shortage of outdoor fun to be had at the camp, or in the
						village of Skaneateles.</p>
						<h3>The Ceremony</h3>
						<p>Weather permitting, the ceremony will be held on the waterfront at 4 p.m.</p>
						<h3>Afterwords...</h3>
						<p>After the ceremony, enjoy snacks and drinks on the boathouse deck
						followed by some speeches, dinner, music, dancing and general
						merriment.</p>
						<p>As the night wears on, feel free to head back to your cabin and
						change into something more comfortable. A roaring fire will keep all
						warm as the party continues and the nighttime temperature drops.</p>

					<h3>Lordes Camp</h3>
					<img class="imgClass" src="images/camp/Cabins.jpg"></img>
					<p>We've rented out the entire camp for the weekend, so everyone is
					welcome (and encouraged) to stay with us at the venue! Our goal is
					to make the weekend as fun and easy as possible for all of our
					friends and family. Staying on site means that you won't have to
					worry about post-party driving arrangements or pay for hotel!
					Furthermore you'll get to enjoy all of the lakeside activities that
					the camp has to offer.</p>

					<div class="txtClass">
						<h3>A Few Things to Note:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Although staying on site is free, please be aware that the
								accommodations are relatively rustic. Relive your childhood summer
								camp experience with twin beds and a communal bathroom.
							</li>
						</br>
							<li>
								We ask that guests who will be driving and staying at the camp bring
								their own sheets and blankets. If you are flying, please let us know
								and we will try our best to make arrangements for you.
							</li>
						</br>
							<li>
								If you can't live without the amenities of a hotel, we would suggest booking a
								nearby room on Airbnb.com or VRBO.com. Otherwise the closest motels
								can be found on Rt. 20 in Skaneateles, the nearest hotels are in
								Cortland or Auburn (about 30/40 away minutes respectively).
								Please let us know as far in advance as possible if you would like to
								stay at the camp. There will be plenty of room, but we'd like a rough
								headcount for planning purposes.

					<p>We ask our guests to dress in a way that will work both indoors and outdoors in anticipation of unpredictable September weather. We suggest "Smart Casual" attire: a jacket or sport coat for men and dresses for women.</p>

					<p>We will have an open bar serving beer and wine during the cocktail

					served during the cocktail hour immediately following the ceremony.
					When the couple is done with photos, we will move to the boathouse for
					a BBQ dinner.</br>
					For those staying at the camp (hopefully all of you!) please plan on bringing
					snacks or heading into town for lunch on the 24th before the festivities
					begin.
